1)What do you mean by an Array?
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations.

2)How to create an Array?
You can create an array by defining the type of elements it will hold and specifying its size. Example:
int[] arr = new int[5];

3)Can we change the size of an array at run time?
No, the size of an array in Java is fixed once it is created. To change the size, you would need to create a new array and copy the elements.

4)Can you declare an array without assigning the size of an array?
Yes, you can declare an array without specifying the size but you must assign it later. Example:
int[] arr;
arr = new int[5];

5)What is the default value of an Array?
The default values depend on the type of the array:
For integers: 0
For booleans: false
For objects: null

6)What is a 1D array with an example?
A 1D array is a linear collection of elements. Example:
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

7)Write a program on a 2D array?
public class TwoDArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] arr = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9} };
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
