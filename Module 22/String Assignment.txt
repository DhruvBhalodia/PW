1. What is a String in Java?  
   A `String` in Java is a sequence of characters, represented by the `String` class. It is used to store and manipulate text.

2. Types of String in Java?  
   String literals: These are created by enclosing characters in double quotes, e.g., `"Hello"`.  
   String objects: Created using the `new` keyword, e.g., `new String("Hello")`.

3. In how many ways can you create string objects in Java?  
   Using string literals:
     String str1 = "Hello";
   Using the `new` keyword:
     String str2 = new String("Hello");

4. What is a string constant pool?
   The string constant pool is a special memory region in the JVM where string literals are stored. It helps in reusing string objects to save memory.

5. What do you mean by mutable and immutable objects? 
   Mutable objects can be changed after they are created (e.g., `StringBuilder`).  
   Immutable objects cannot be modified once they are created (e.g., `String`).

6. Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory?  
   The string constant pool is located in the heap memory but is managed separately from other objects, ensuring efficient memory usage for string literals.
