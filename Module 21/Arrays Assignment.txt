1) What is the default value of Array for different data types?
For integers: 0
For booleans: false
For characters: '\u0000'
For floating-point types (float, double): 0.0
For object references: null

2) Can you pass the negative number in Array size?
No, array size cannot be negative. It throws a NegativeArraySizeException if you try to pass a negative number.

3) Where does an Array store in JVM memory?
Arrays are stored in the heap memory, regardless of whether they are local or instance arrays.

4) What are the disadvantages of Array?
Fixed size: Once created, the size of an array cannot be changed.
Inflexible: Array elements are of the same data type.
Difficult to manage memory for large data sets.
Insertion and deletion are not efficient for large arrays.

5) What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an example.
An anonymous array is an array created without a variable reference, typically used in method calls. Example:
public class AnonymousArray {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printArray(new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
    }

    static void printArray(int[] arr) {
        for (int i : arr) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}

6) What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java?
Using a for loop:
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
}
Using an enhanced for loop:
for (int value : arr) {
    System.out.print(value + " ");
}

7) What is the difference between length and length() method? Give an Example.
length is a property of an array that gives the number of elements in the array.
Example:
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
System.out.println(arr.length);  // Output: 3
length() is a method of the String class, used to get the number of characters in a string.
Example:
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.length());  // Output: 5
