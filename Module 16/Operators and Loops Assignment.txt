1) What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
Conditional operators include the ternary operator ?: (used for decision-making) and logical operators like &&, ||, and !.

2) What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
Unary: Operate on one operand (e.g., ++, --).
Binary: Operate on two operands (e.g., +, -, *, /).
Ternary: Operates on three operands (e.g., condition ? trueValue : falseValue).

3) What is the use of Switch case in Java programming
The switch case simplifies complex if-else ladders by matching a variable against multiple cases for specific actions.

4) What are the priority levels of arithmetic operation in Java?
Parentheses ()
Multiplication, Division, Modulus (*, /, %)
Addition, Subtraction (+, -)

5) What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
Conditional statements like if, if-else, and switch allow decision-making in programs based on certain conditions.

6) What is the syntax of if else statement?
if (condition) {
    // Code 
} else {
    // Code 
}

7) What are the 3 types of iterative statements in java?
for loop
while loop
do-while loop

8) Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?
For Loop: The condition is checked before executing the loop body.
Do-While Loop: The loop body is executed at least once before the condition is checked.

9) Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }
}
