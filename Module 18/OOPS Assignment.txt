1)How to Create an Object in Java?
Use the new keyword to allocate memory and create an object. Example:
ClassName obj = new ClassName();

2)What is the use of a new keyword in Java?
The new keyword allocates memory for objects in the heap and initializes them. Itâ€™s used to instantiate classes.

3)What are the different types of variables in Java?
Local variables are declared inside methods or blocks.
Instance variables are declared in a class but outside any method.
Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.

4)What is the difference between Instance variable and Local variables?
Instance variables belong to objects and are stored in heap memory. Local variables are confined to methods or blocks and stored in stack memory.

5)In which area memory is allocated for instance variable and local variable?
Instance variables are stored in heap memory, while local variables are stored in stack memory.

6)What is method overloading?
Defining multiple methods with the same name but differing in parameter type, number, or order. Example:
void show(int x) { }
void show(String y) { }
